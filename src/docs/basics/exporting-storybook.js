    Storybook gives a great developer experience with its dev time features, like instance change updates via Webpack's HMR.

    But Storybook is also a tool you can use to showcase your components to others.
    Demos of [React Native Web](http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/storybook/) and [React Dates](http://airbnb.io/react-dates/) are a good example for that.

    For that, Storybook comes with a tool to export your storybook into a static web app. Then you can deploy it to GitHub pages or any static hosting service.

    Simply add the following NPM script:

    ~~~sh
    {
      ...
      "scripts": {
        "storybook": "build-storybook -c .storybook -o .out"
      }
      ...
    }
    ~~~

    Then run \`npm run storybook\`.

    This will build the storybook configured in the Storybook directory into a static webpack and place it inside the \`.out\` directory.
    Now you can deploy the content of the inside \`.out\` directory whenever you want.

    To test it locally, simply run the following commands:

    ~~~sh
    cd .out
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ~~~

    ## Deploying to GitHub Pages

    Additionally, you can deploy Storybook directly into GitHub pages with our [storybook-deployer](https://github.com/kadirahq/storybook-deployer) tool.

    Or, you can simply export your storybook into the docs directory and use it as the root for GitHub pages. Have a look at [this guide](https://github.com/blog/2233-publish-your-project-documentation-with-github-pages) for more information.
