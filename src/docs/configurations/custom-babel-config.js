    By default, Storybook loads your root \`.babelrc\` file and load those configurations. But sometimes some of those options may cause Storybook to throw errors.

    In that case, you can provide a custom \`.babelrc\` just for Storybook. For that, simply create a file called \`.babelrc\` file inside the Storybook config directory (by default, it's \`.storybook\`).

    Then Storybook will load the Babel configuration only from that file.

    > Currently we do not support loading the Babel config from the package.json.
