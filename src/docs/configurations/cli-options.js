    React Storybook comes with two CLI utilities. They are \`start-storybook\` and \`build-storybook\`.

    They have some options you can pass to alter the storybook behaviors. We have seen some of them in previous docs.

    Here are all those options:

    ## For start-storybook

    ~~~
    Usage: start-storybook [options]

    Options:

      -h, --help                    output usage information
      -V, --version                 output the version number
      -p, --port [number]           Port to run Storybook (Required)
      -h, --host [string]           Host to run Storybook
      -s, --static-dir <dir-names>  Directory where to load static files from
      -c, --config-dir [dir-name]   Directory where to load Storybook configurations from
    ~~~

    ## For build-storybook
